    <b>Manure Definition</b>
    <br />
    “Manure is organic matter derived primarily from animal and plant wastes,
    used to improve soil quality, enhance nutrient availability, and increase
    the yield of healthy crops in a sustainable manner.”
    <br /><br />

    <b>What is Manure?</b>
    <br />
    Manure is the decomposed form of plant residues, animal excreta, and organic
    waste materials that is applied to soil as a natural fertilizer. It is rich
    in essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium
    (K), which are vital for plant growth and development.
    <br /><br />

    Unlike chemical fertilizers, manure improves soil health over time by
    increasing organic matter and humus content. It enhances soil structure,
    promotes beneficial microbial activity, and improves aeration without
    causing environmental pollution. As a renewable resource, manure plays a
    key role in sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Sources of Manure</b>
    <br />
    Manure can be obtained from a wide variety of organic sources, including:
    <br />
    • Cattle dung, urine, and slurry from biogas plants
    <br />
    • Human waste, sewage sludge, and domestic organic waste
    <br />
    • Droppings of goats, sheep, and poultry
    <br />
    • Slaughterhouse waste such as bones, meat residues, and fish waste
    <br />
    • Agricultural by-products and crop residues
    <br />
    • Weeds, garden waste, and water hyacinth
    <br /><br />

    <b>Types of Manure</b>
    <br />
    Based on origin and method of preparation, manure is broadly classified
    into farmyard manure, green manure, and compost manure. Each type plays a
    specific role in improving soil fertility.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Green Manure</b>
    <br />
    Green manure consists of fast-growing plants that are cultivated and then
    ploughed back into the soil. It increases organic matter, improves soil
    texture, suppresses weed growth, and helps prevent soil erosion while
    enhancing nutrient availability.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Farmyard Manure</b>
    <br />
    Farmyard manure is a mixture of cattle dung, urine, litter, and leftover
    feed. It improves soil structure, increases water-holding capacity, and
    boosts microbial activity, leading to better nutrient absorption by plants.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Compost Manure</b>
    <br />
    Compost manure is produced through the controlled decomposition of organic
    waste such as kitchen scraps, crop residues, and garden waste. It enhances
    soil fertility, improves nutrient value, and supports healthy plant growth.
    <br /><br />

    <b>Advantages of Manure</b>
    <br />
    • Improves soil fertility and long-term productivity
    <br />
    • Cost-effective and easily available
    <br />
    • Reduces soil erosion and nutrient leaching
    <br />
    • Enhances water and nutrient retention
    <br />
    • Environment friendly and non-polluting
    <br /><br />

    In addition to improving soil quality, manure produces methane gas as a
    by-product during decomposition, which can be utilized for cooking and
    heating purposes. Crops grown using manure are generally healthier, more
    resilient, and nutritionally superior.
    <br /><br />

    Overall, manure improves soil sustainability, increases water-holding
    capacity, supports organic farming practices, and contributes significantly
    to increased agricultural productivity and environmental conservation.
